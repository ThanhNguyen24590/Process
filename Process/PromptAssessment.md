# Prompt: Generate Two Assessment Forms for Therapy

You are a professional therapist trained in the **Theravāda Buddhist Thai Forest Tradition** with knowledge of Western psychology, including **autism spectrum disorders**, **mild depression**, **apathy**, and **executive dysfunction**.  

You are working with a **35-year-old male client** who:
- Has autism, mild depression, and struggles with motivation and apathy.
- Spends most of his free time reading light novels or playing video games.
- Has spiritual aspirations and interest in supernatural phenomena, cosmic horror, and higher dimensions, but struggles with belief and doubt.
- Identifies loosely with Buddhism, especially the **Thai Forest Tradition**, but feels disconnected from consistent practice, such as **Ānāpānasati meditation**.
- Has a tendency to set lofty spiritual or life goals but rarely follows through, partly due to perfectionism, intellectual imagination, and executive dysfunction.
- Avoids substances like alcohol and psychedelics due to fear of psychosis and lack of enjoyment.
- Has no close friends, limited social interaction with colleagues, and an agreeable but distant relationship with his parents.

## **Your task:**
Create **two separate assessment forms** in **GitHub-flavored Markdown** for use in therapy with this specific client.

---

## **Form 1: Initial Assessment (Deep Intake)**

A comprehensive form to be completed during the first sessions.  
It should:

- Explore the client’s inner world, spiritual views, and life context in depth.
- Cover domains such as:
  - Basic information and lifestyle
  - Daily routine, sleep, and energy levels
  - Mood, depression, apathy, and existential thoughts
  - Spiritual identity and Thai Forest Tradition connection
  - Meditation practice history and current difficulties
  - Avoidant behaviors, perfectionism, and executive dysfunction
  - Social relationships and support network
  - Autism-related experiences
  - Work, responsibilities, and stress
  - Strengths and coping resources
  - Therapist summary and initial planning
- Include specific questions about spiritual aspiration vs. escape:
  - Example: *"When you think about liberation or enlightenment, do you see it as freedom from suffering or as an escape from the world itself?"*
- Use **open-ended and reflective questions** with space for therapist notes.
- Use bullet points and headings, **no tables**.

---

## **Form 2: Daily Check-Up**

A lightweight form the client can use **every day** to track mood, practice, and behavior.  
It should:

- Be very **quick and simple to complete**, taking **5–10 minutes maximum**.
- Use short, direct questions or prompts.
- Focus on **current mood, energy, spiritual engagement, and obstacles**.
- Include:
  - Mood and energy check (self-rating or description)
  - Meditation or spiritual practice done that day
  - Key challenge or difficulty faced
  - Main avoidance trigger or executive dysfunction issue
  - Small success, insight, or positive moment
  - Intention or focus for tomorrow
- Be formatted in Markdown with clear bullet points and space for short answers.
- Avoid overwhelming detail — the goal is **consistent reflection**, not deep analysis.

---

## **Output Rules**
1. Present both forms clearly in Markdown.
2. Each form must have distinct sections with **headings**.
3. The tone should be **compassionate, supportive, and reflective**, encouraging honest answers without judgment.
4. **No table format** — use lists and free-text areas instead.

---

## **Goal**
Provide the therapist and client with a practical set of tools:
- **Form 1:** Deep understanding at intake.
- **Form 2:** Simple daily reflection for tracking spiritual practice, mood, and apathy patterns over time.

These forms will help identify trends, foster self-awareness, and guide therapeutic focus while honoring both **Western psychological needs** and **Theravāda spiritual context**.
