#### Svākkhāto bhagavatā dhammo
+ **Goal & Boundary:** clearly defined by Buddha -> make clear what your daily choice is Dhamma or not, with no room for confusion or deceit.
+ **Concept:** clearly defined through definition, example, counter-example, from multiple approach and how to verified, with action's steps detailed. Ex: jhana, how to deal with bad thoughs,...
+ **Thematic Structure:** clearly show what causes harm, what's long-term benefits & the actions to reach them accordingly, follow gradual pedagogical progression (anupubbasikkhā), making foundation for Conviction & Practice Direction.
  + Multiple approach of same path: Atthangika-Magga (sila, samadhi, panna), sattapadā (MN 137) , deepening of sukhaṁ (in MN101: anavajja), action (an10.68)..
+ **Transmission:** carefully crafted, preserved, explained through unbroken lineage, ensuring them accessible and authentic:
  + Buddha adapted teachings for individuals and communities, using repetition, numbered lists, and rhythmic phrasing to support memorization and reflection.
  + The early Saṅgha organized and recited the teachings collectively at councils to maintain precision and clarity.
  + Generations of practitioners safeguarded the oral tradition until modern times, when translations and texts made the Dhamma available worldwide. There are sutta chanting to this day.
  
#### Sandiṭṭhiko
- **Accessible:** can be practice or studied in anytime, anywhere, by anyone, in any situation, as Dhamma is about the mind.
- Supramundane vision of beauty can only be appreciate through practice, move beyond labels or concepts to directly see.
- Practice Can only work with introspection (of sankara), as mirror checking reflection [MN 61](https://suttacentral.net/mn61/en/sujato?lang=en)
- **Result** are visible  (joy, groundedness)
  - Here and Now: A single ānāpāna-sati can bring joy, clarity and calm.
  - Powers: Mundane or supermundance.
  - Life: Give sense of purpose, direction, confirmation about the Transcendence, against confusion & Mara. Ex: mettā (AN 5.43) 

#### Akāliko
+ One End: Endless samsara as multi-verse, manifest this reality.
+ Other End: Nibbāna & The path lead to it, always be existing, althought hidden. [AN 3.136](https://suttacentral.net/an3.136/en/sujato) 
+ This **limited** life can be make infinite by the Path of Ariay Sacca
+ **Direct Contact** with the Timeless beyond the flow of past, present, and future. This is the singularity in chaos system, the Refuge..
  - By deep meditation (samādhi, jhāna, arūpa-jhāna, and Nibbāna)
  - By direct realization, immediately upon hearing the Dhamma.

#### Ehipassiko
- **Savana – Listen:** Dhamma-cakkhu is worthy of being seen, inviting all who willing to hear the Dhamma.
- **Cintā – Reflect:** Encourage thoughtful investigation, weighing the teachings against personal experience and reasoning, with doubt's transformed into inquiry, leading to clarity and protection against dogma or misunderstanding.
  - Monastic Saṅgha provides living examples of the path and discipline, open to critize.
- **Bhāvanā – Cultivate & Test:** Encourages moving from theory to practice and direct experience, turning your life into a living experiment where results can be tested immediately. 
  - Test & finding what works for your temperament, using the wide array of medicine-meditation objects (40 and many more recollection themes) for moment-to-moment state-of-mind. 
  - Acts of generosity, mindfulness, or restraint show visible benefits in relationships and mental well-being.
  - As practice reveals what truly works, false claims and distortions're exposed, misunderstandings naturally self-correct.
- **Passanā – See:** With steady practice, direct insight (cattāri ariya-saccā, paṭiccasamuppāda,..) are directly seen & move beyond mere concepts.
- **Paṭivedha – Realize:** goes beyond speculation, belief, or external authority, to directly know the nature of your mind.

#### Opanayiko – Leading Inward
- **Direction:** leads the mind away from external entanglements towards inward freedom, align your actions to deal with dukkha.
- **Force:** Similar to kite-flying, the initial force comes from your effort, but the primary momentum comes from the mind’s natural inclination towards its nourishment — whether that is joy, truth, or freedom.
  + **Kalyāṇamitta** (spiritual friends and teachers) offer guidance and correction.
  + Lay communities support each other through generosity and shared practice.
  + Rituals like chanting, almsgiving, and group meditation build collective energy.
- **Path:** Unfolds gradually, steadily, and sustainably. It is clear with the progress, layer by layer, through the Atthangika-Magga (Sīla, Samādhi, and Paññā), with each element reinforcing the others.
- **Correction:** Inherent feedback mechanism that naturally corrects itself through direct experience, guiding the practitioner back toward the right course when missteps occur.

#### Paccattaṁ veditabbo viññūhi
- The Dhamma's personal, progress or regressed by each of your very own choices, wise or unwise. 
- The Dhamma can be practice in any situation with the right tools, as it is of mind. Not Kamma nor situation, you have only yourself to blame.
- Others, through experience or power will recognize what your progress or state of mind > who you are.
- Living principals're shared by the community.
