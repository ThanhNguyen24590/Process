Svākkhāto bhagavatā dhammo, Sandiṭṭhiko, Akāliko, Ehipassiko, Opanayiko, Paccattaṁ veditabbo viññūhi.
<details><summary>4 facets: Pariyatti, Paṭipatti, Bhāvanā, Paṭivedha</summary>
+ Scriptural (Pariyatti): Texts, structure, and tradition of preserving and transmitting the teachings.
+ Practical Life (Paṭipatti): Daily practial application — Dhamma in real-world behavior, choices, and practice.
+ Experiential / Meditative (Bhāvanā): Direct inner experience - observation and cultivation during meditation. The psychological and phenomenological layer -> systematic inner transformation
+ Supramundane / Transcendent (Paṭivedha):	The ultimate realization — liberation, Nibbāna, final wisdom.
</details>

#### Svākkhāto bhagavatā dhammo
+ Clarity of Goal: Buddha clearly defined what's truly Dhamma and what's not based on the results 
+ Clarity of Thematic Structure: The teachings follow a gradual pedagogical progression (anupubbasikkhā): generosity → virtue → concentration → wisdom → liberation.
+ Integrity of Transmission: carefully crafted, preserved, explained through an unbroken lineage, ensuring they remain accessible and authentic:
  + Buddha adapted teachings for individuals and communities, using repetition, numbered lists, and rhythmic phrasing to support memorization and reflection.
  + The early Saṅgha organized and recited the teachings collectively at councils to maintain precision and clarity.
  + Generations of practitioners safeguarded the oral tradition until modern times, when translations and texts made the Dhamma available worldwide. There are sutta chanting to this day.
+ Self-Verifying Nature: Dhamma can be confirmed through direct experience and practice, allowing practitioners to see its truth for themselves at each stage.
  
#### Sandiṭṭhiko
- Accessible Anytime, Anywhere, by Anyone: The Dhamma is a training of the mind, not bound by place, culture, or era.
- Immediate Benefits: The fruits of practice can be felt right away, even with the smallest effort.
  - A single moment of mindful breathing (ānāpānasati) can bring clarity and calm.
  - Practice brings joy and groundedness, marking real progress in letting go.
- See and Know for Yourself: The Dhamma is to be personally confirmed through direct observation of body, mind, and practice.
  - Move beyond labels like “body” or “mind” to directly see raw phenomena as they are.
  - Witness causality unfolding in real time, seeing dependent co-arising directly.
- Progressive Verification and Deepening: can be verified at any stage; early results encourage continued practice, and sustained practice deepens and broadens what can directly see and know.
  - Small, immediate confirmations (calm, insight, reduced reactivity) validate further training.
  - Continued practice uncovers subtler truths (insight, jhānic stability, deeper release).

#### Akāliko
+ Unbroken Living Lineage and Verification Across Generations
+ Timeless Truth: its root not in culture, dogmas, philosophy but universal principles. Even if no Buddha appears, these truths still exist, waiting to be rediscovered.[AN 3.136](https://suttacentral.net/an3.136/en/sujato) 
+ Unchanging Reality Beyond Words: The teachings are expressions of this reality, but even if the texts are lost,
the Dhamma they point to remains ever-present.The Buddha did not create the Dhamma; he discovered and revealed it.
+ Direct Contact with the Timeless: Through deep meditation (samādhi, jhāna, arūpa-jhāna, and Nibbāna) one can personally experience the timeless reality, beyond the flow of past, present, and future.
#### Ehipassiko
- **Savana – Listen:** Openly invitate for anyone willing to hear the Dhamma, where even a single verse can plant the seed of understanding and inspiration.
- **Cintā – Reflect:** Encourage thoughtful investigation, weighing the teachings against personal experience and reasoning, with doubt's transformed into inquiry, leading to clarity and protection against dogma or misunderstanding.
- **Bhāvanā – Cultivate & Test:** Encourages moving from theory to practice and direct experience, turning your life into a living experiment where results can be tested immediately. As practice reveals what truly works, false claims and distortions're exposed, misunderstandings naturally self-correct.
- **Passanā – See:** With steady practice, direct insight (cattāri ariya-saccā, paṭiccasamuppāda,..) are directly seen & move beyond mere concepts.
- **Paṭivedha – Realize:**  The culmination is unshakable personal verification of liberation, a direct knowing that goes beyond speculation, belief, or external authority.
#### Opanayiko – Leading Inward
- **Direction:** The path leads the mind away from external entanglements towards inward freedom, dealing with the real problem of dukkha, which arises from the mind itself, driven by the three poisons and the five hindrances.
- **Force:** Similar to kite-flying, the initial force comes from your effort, but the primary momentum comes from the mind’s natural inclination towards its nourishment — whether that is joy, truth, or freedom.
- **Path:** Unfolds gradually, steadily, and sustainably. It is clear with the progress, layer by layer, through the Atthangika-Magga (Sīla, Samādhi, and Paññā), with each element reinforcing the others.
- **Correction:** Inherent feedback mechanism that naturally corrects itself through direct experience, guiding the practitioner back toward the right course when missteps occur.
#### Paccattaṁ veditabbo viññūhi
- The Dhamma's personal, progress or regressed by each of your very own choices, wise or unwise. 
- The Dhamma can be practice in any situation with the right tools, as it is of mind. Not Kamma nor situation, you have only yourself to blame.
- Others, through experience or power will recognize what your progress or state of mind > who you are.
- Living principals're shared by the community.
