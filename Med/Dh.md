#### Svākkhāto bhagavatā dhammo
+ **Goal & Boundary:** clearly defined by Buddha -> make clear what your daily choice is Dhamma or not, with no room for confusion or deceit.
+ **Concept:** clearly defined through definition, example, counter-example, from multiple approach and how to verified, with action's steps detailed. Ex: jhana, how to deal with bad thoughs,...
+ **Thematic Structure:** clearly show what causes harm, what's long-term benefits & the actions to reach them accordingly, follow gradual pedagogical progression (anupubbasikkhā), making foundation for Conviction & Practice Direction.
  + Multiple approach of same path: Atthangika-Magga (sila, samadhi, panna), sattapadā (MN 137) , deepening of sukhaṁ (in MN101: anavajja), action (an10.68)..
  + Test & finding what works for your temperament, using the wide array of medicine-Kammaṭṭhāna & theme for moment-to-moment state-of-mind. 
+ **Transmission:** carefully crafted, preserved, explained through unbroken lineage, ensuring them accessible and authentic:
  + Buddha adapted teachings for individuals and communities, using repetition, numbered lists, and rhythmic phrasing to support memorization and reflection.
  + The early Saṅgha organized and recited the teachings collectively at councils to maintain precision and clarity.
  + Generations of practitioners safeguarded the oral tradition until modern times, when translations and texts made the Dhamma available worldwide. There are sutta chanting to this day.
  
#### Sandiṭṭhiko
- **Accessible:** can be practice or studied in anytime, anywhere, by anyone, in any situation, as Dhamma is about the mind.
- Supramundane vision of beauty can only be appreciate through practice, move beyond labels or concepts to directly see.
- Practice Can only work with introspection (of sankara), as mirror checking reflection [MN 61](https://suttacentral.net/mn61/en/sujato?lang=en)
- **Result** are visible  (joy, groundedness)
  - Here and Now: A single ānāpāna-sati can bring joy, clarity and calm.
  - Powers: Mundane or supermundance.
  - Life: Give sense of purpose, direction, confirmation about the Transcendence, against confusion & Mara. Ex: mettā (AN 5.43) 

#### Akāliko
+ One End: Endless samsara as multi-verse, manifest this reality.
+ Other End: Nibbāna & The path lead to it, always be existing, althought hidden. [AN 3.136](https://suttacentral.net/an3.136/en/sujato) 
+ This **limited** life can be make infinite by the Path of Ariay Sacca
+ **Direct Contact** with the Timeless beyond time & space. This's the singularity in chaos system, the Refuge.
  - By deep meditation (samādhi, jhāna, arūpa-jhāna, and Nibbāna)
  - By direct realization, immediately upon hearing the Dhamma.

#### Ehipassiko
- Announcement to the world, open invitation to all who has ear. This is what need to be seen, need to be seek. [MN 26](https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato?lang=en) Even you have doubts, there is unfalling practice to be take. [MN 60](https://suttacentral.net/mn60/en/sujato?lang=en)

#### Opanayiko
- Lead inward to freedom, away from Mara [MN 25](https://suttacentral.net/mn25/en/sujato?lang=en), tested by 8 winds.
- The calling, the natural path.
- Intitial efforts are needed, but the momentum comes from the mind’s natural inclination towards its nourishment (joy, truth, or freedom), like flying kite. 
  + **Kalyāṇamitta** offer guidance and correction.
  + Rituals like chanting, almsgiving, and group meditation build collective energy.
  + Lay communities support each other through generosity and shared practice.

#### Paccattaṁ veditabbo viññūhi
- The Dhamma's personal, progress or regressed by each of your very own choices, wise or unwise. 
- The Dhamma can be practice in any situation with the right tools, as it is of mind. Not Kamma nor situation, you have only yourself to blame.
- Others, through experience or power will recognize what your progress or state of mind > who you are.
- Living principals're shared by the community.
